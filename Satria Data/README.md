# Project Description

Social media has become a vast and diverse source of data, enabling comprehensive analysis of public dynamics and opinions. During the Indonesian presidential campaign season, the intensity of activity on platforms like **X (formerly Twitter)** increases significantly. These platforms serve as vital arenas for communication, mass mobilization, and ideological debates. The data generated during these campaigns provide valuable insights into voter behavior, public sentiment, and the dynamics of the elections.

This project focuses on addressing the challenges of processing and analyzing unstructured, high-volume **User-Generated Content (UGC)** from X. Specifically, it aims to classify tweets related to the **2024 Indonesian Presidential Election** into eight classes derived from the **Astagatra Framework**â€”a set of components representing national resilience:

1. **Ideology**: Fundamental values, principles, and worldviews guiding the nation.
2. **Politics**: Government systems, policies, and political processes.
3. **Economy**: Resource and financial management for societal prosperity.
4. **Socio-Culture**: Social values, cultural norms, and aspects of societal life influencing national integrity.
5. **Defense and Security**: National defense and internal security against threats or disturbances.
6. **Natural Resources**: Management and utilization of natural resources for national development and security.
7. **Geography**: Physical conditions, location, and environment influencing policies and national life.
8. **Demography**: Population structure, growth, and dynamics impacting policies and development.

The project leverages machine learning to build an accurate **multiclass text classification model** capable of categorizing tweets into these eight classes. This requires handling challenges such as:

- Ambiguity in tweet content.
- Sarcasm and implicit meanings.
- Variations in language usage and typos common in UGC.

The dataset provided for this project contains complete tweet texts along with their respective labels. To ensure fairness, participants are restricted to using this dataset without incorporating external data.

### Objectives

- **Voter Behavior Analysis**: Understanding motivations and concerns influencing voter participation.
- **Campaign Optimization**: Identifying key topics and tailoring strategies to improve engagement.
- **Election Outcome Prediction**: Developing predictive models based on sentiment and discussion patterns.
- **Disinformation Detection**: Analyzing patterns to identify and mitigate misinformation campaigns.
- **Polarization Mapping**: Understanding polarization dynamics through network and sentiment analysis.

The solutions developed in this project aim to address these challenges creatively and innovatively, contributing to a deeper understanding of electoral dynamics in Indonesia.
